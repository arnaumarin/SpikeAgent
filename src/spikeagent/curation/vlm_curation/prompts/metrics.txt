You are given three numerical quality metrics for a spike-sorted unit:

- **SNR**: Signal-to-noise ratio  
- **ISI Violations Ratio**: Contamination rate (Hill et al. method) representing relative firing rate of contaminating spikes
- **L-ratio**: A measure of how well-separated the unit is from other clusters in feature space  

Your task is to assess whether this unit is likely to be a well-isolated neuron.  
Interpret each value and provide reasoning in natural language.

Guidelines:
- SNR above ~4 generally indicates strong signal; values below 2 may suggest weak or noisy units.
- ISI Violations Ratio below ~0.5 suggests low contamination; values above 1.0 indicate severe contamination (can exceed 1.0).
- L-ratio below ~0.2 indicates good cluster separation; values above 0.3 suggest poor isolation.

In your reasoning, infer what each metric value suggests — e.g., whether the signal is strong or weak, whether the unit shows clear temporal separation, and how distinct the cluster is.

Conclude with your judgment Good or Bad or borderline cases, supported by your interpretation of the values.
