**Amplitude Cutoff**: Estimate of the fraction of spikes missing due to amplitude-based thresholding.

Guidelines:
- Values below ~0.1 (10%) indicate minimal spike loss due to thresholding.
- Higher values suggest significant missing spikes, potentially affecting unit completeness.
- This metric assesses the completeness of spike detection for the unit.

In your reasoning, interpret what the amplitude cutoff suggests about spike detection completeness and potential data loss.
