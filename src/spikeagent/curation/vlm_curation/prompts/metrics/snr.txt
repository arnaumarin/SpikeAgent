**SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: A measure of signal strength relative to background noise.

Guidelines:
- SNR above ~4 generally indicates strong signal; values below 2 may suggest weak or noisy units.
- Higher values indicate better signal quality and more reliable spike detection.
- Very low SNR values (< 1.5) typically indicate poor unit isolation or excessive noise contamination.

In your reasoning, interpret what the SNR value suggests about signal strength and reliability of the unit detection.
