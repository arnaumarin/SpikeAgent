**NN Hit Rate**: The rate at which nearest neighbor classification correctly identifies the unit among its neighboring units.

Guidelines:
- Values above ~0.5 (50%) generally indicate good unit distinctiveness from neighbors.
- Higher values suggest better separation from surrounding units in feature space.
- Values below 0.3 may indicate poor unit isolation or overlap with neighboring clusters.

In your reasoning, interpret what the NN hit rate suggests about the unit's distinctiveness and separability from neighboring units.
