**Presence Ratio**: The fraction of time bins in which the unit was detected, indicating temporal consistency.

Guidelines:
- Values above ~0.9 (90%) indicate consistent presence throughout the recording.
- Lower values may suggest intermittent detection or unit instability over time.
- This metric assesses the temporal stability and consistency of the unit.

In your reasoning, interpret what the presence ratio suggests about unit stability and temporal consistency throughout the recording session.
