**NN Miss Rate**: The rate at which nearest neighbor classification fails to correctly identify the unit.

Guidelines:
- Values below ~0.1 (10%) indicate good unit distinctiveness.
- Higher values suggest poor separation or potential contamination.
- This is the complement of NN hit rate and provides similar but inverse information.

In your reasoning, interpret what the NN miss rate suggests about unit classification reliability and potential confusion with neighboring units.
