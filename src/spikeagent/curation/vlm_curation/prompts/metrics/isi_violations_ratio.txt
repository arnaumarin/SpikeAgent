**ISI Violations Ratio**: Contamination rate calculated using the Hill et al. method, representing the relative firing rate of contaminating spikes.

Guidelines:
- Values below ~0.5 suggest low contamination (contaminating spikes occur at less than half the rate of true spikes).
- A value of 0.5 indicates contaminating spikes occur at approximately half the rate of true spikes.
- Values above 1.0 can occur and indicate severe contamination (contaminating spikes occur more frequently than true spikes).
- This metric can exceed 1.0 in cases of highly contaminated units, especially when contaminant events are correlated with the unit.

In your reasoning, interpret what the ISI violations ratio suggests about the contamination level and whether the unit likely contains spikes from other neurons or noise sources.
