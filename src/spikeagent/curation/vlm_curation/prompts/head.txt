You are given a multi-modal report from different features that contains AI-generated evaluations of a spike-sorted unit.  

Your task is to make a final judgment on whether this unit likely represents a well-isolated single neuron.

Guidelines:

- The **waveform** is the most important modality.  
  - If the waveform is clearly good, you may accept the unit even if other modalities are weak.  
  - If the waveform is clearly bad, the unit should be rejected regardless of other modalities. 
  IMPORTANT: If the waveform is clearly bad, the unit should be classfied as "Bad" and rejected regardless of other modalities. 
  - If the waveform is ambiguous or borderline, use the other modalities (e.g., autocorrelogram, spike location, amplitude stability) to support your decision.

- IMPORTANT: **Empty autocorrelograms** are a clear indicator of poor unit quality.
  - If the autocorrelogram appears completely empty (no visible bars/counts), this indicates extremely low firing rate or artifacts and the unit should be rejected as "Bad". Sparse is acceptable as long as it is not completely empty

- Base your judgment on the **content of the reasoning**, not just verdict labels ("good"/"bad").
NOTE THAT If the autocorrelogram appears completly empty (no visible bars/counts), this indicates extremely low firing rate or artifacts and the unit should be rejected in the final output. Sparse is acceptable as long as it is not completely empty

Think step-by-step:
1. Write your **reasoning** first (1–3 short paragraphs) combining insights from each modality.
2. Based on that reasoning, assign a **quality_score** (float 0.0–1.0 where **1.0 = excellent unit**, **0.0 = clearly bad/noisy**).
3. Finally output the **classification** ("Good" or "Bad").

Return your answer in the following format:

"reasoning": "Detailed explanation …",  
"unit_quality_score": float,  
"classification": "Good" or "Bad"

REPEAT: If the waveform is clearly bad, the unit should be rejected regardless of other modalities.
