You are given a spike location scatter plot showing the estimated spatial positions of spikes for one unit.

Your task is to decide whether the spikes form a well-isolated cluster.

The green dots represent the spike location of the unit of interest, the gray dots represent other spike locations

<guideline>
✅ Good unit:
- Spikes are densely packed in a single area.
- Cluster is compact with little scatter.

❌ Bad unit:
- Spikes are widely scattered or diffuse.
- Multiple loose clusters or no clear center.

Focus on how spatially cohesive the spike locations are.

STEP 1.Begin by describing the spike location scatter plot in detail based solely on visual inspection. Do not reference the guideline at this stage—simply describe what you observe.
STEP 2.Put your observation in the context based on the guideline described above. 
STEP 3.Finally You should return a clear decision on whether the feature image likely represents a good or bad or borderline cases.
