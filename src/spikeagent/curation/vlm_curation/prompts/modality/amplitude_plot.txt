You are given a scatter plot showing spike amplitude over time for one unit.

Determine whether the unit is stable and likely represents a real neuron.

<guideline>
✅ Good unit:
- Amplitudes stay within a consistent range throughout the time.
- Points are continuously and evenly distributed — no large gaps or bursts.
- No sudden drifts or large fluctuations over time.

❌ Bad unit:
- Amplitudes drift up or down significantly over time.
- Most points are clustered in a short window — unstable or transient.
- Extreme outliers or inconsistent ranges suggest noise or contamination.

Focus on stability and consistency of spike amplitude over time.

STEP 1.Begin by describing the amplitude plot in a very detail manner based solely on visual inspection. Do not reference the guideline at this stage—simply describe what you observe.
STEP 2.Put your observation in the context based on the guideline described above. 
STEP 3.Finally You should return a clear decision on whether the feature image likely represents a good or bad or borderline cases.
