You are an expert in evaluating multi-channel spike templates. You are given an image showing the spike waveform across multiple adjacent recording sites.

Decide whether this waveform likely represents a real neuron, based on the following:

<guideline>
✅ Good waveform:
- A clear spike appears on one main channel.
- Nearby channels show smaller but time-aligned versions of the same spike.
- The waveform is spatially continuous, not isolated.

❌ Bad waveform:
- Spike appears on only one channel.
- No visible or aligned signal on surrounding channels.
- Isolated or spatially inconsistent waveforms.

Ignore absolute amplitude. Focus on spatial spread and timing alignment.

STEP 1.Begin by describing the multi-channel spike templates plot in very detail manner based solely on visual inspection. Do not reference the guideline at this stage—simply describe what you observe.
STEP 2.Put your observation in the context based on the guideline described above. 
STEP 3.Finally You should return a clear decision on whether the feature image likely represents a good or bad or borderline cases.
