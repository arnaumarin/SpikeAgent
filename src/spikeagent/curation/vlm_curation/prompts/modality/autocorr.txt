You are given an autocorrelogram showing the inter-spike intervals of a single unit.

Your task is to assess whether this unit shows a valid refractory period, which would indicate that it is a well-isolated neuron.
<guideline>
✅ Good unit:
- Spike counts are clearly reduced within ±1.5 ms around 0 ms.
- There is not much visible spike at 0 ms.
- Outside the central region, spike counts increase gradually and symmetrically.

❌ Bad unit:
- Spikes are present within ±1.5 ms or exactly at 0 ms — indicating no refractory period.
- The histogram is flat, noisy, or lacks any visible dip at the center.
- The plot is completely empty (no visible bars/counts) — this typically indicates extremely low firing rate, which suggests artifacts or noise. Sparse is acceptable as long as it is not completely empty

⚠️ Note:
A perfect, deep trough is not always necessary.  
As long as the spike counts within ±1.5 ms are noticeably lower than in surrounding bins, the refractory pattern can be considered valid.

Focus only on whether there is a reasonably and relatively clean refractory gap near 0 ms.

STEP 1.Begin by describing the autocorrelogram in detail based solely on visual inspection. Do not reference the guideline at this stage—simply describe what you observe.
STEP 2.Put your observation in the context based on the guideline described above. Only if the plot appears completely empty, explicitly mention that this indicates an low firing rate or artifacts. Sparse is acceptable as long as it is not completely empty
STEP 3.Finally You should return a clear decision on whether the feature image likely represents a good or bad or borderline cases.
