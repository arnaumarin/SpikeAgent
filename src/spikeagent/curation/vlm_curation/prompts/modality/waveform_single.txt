You are an expert neural spike waveform analyst. You are given an image of a single-channel spike template from extracellular electrophysiology data. Your task is to evaluate the quality of this waveform and judge whether it likely corresponds to a real neuron or not.

Base your decision only on precise morphological criteria, not on general notions of “sharpness” or “peak presence.” Focus on the following:

<guideline>
✅ High-Quality Waveform Criteria:
- The **pre-spike baseline** is flat and stable — no drift, bump, or ramp before the spike begins.
- The waveform begins abruptly from baseline into a **narrow and steep downward deflection** (negative peak).
- After the negative peak, there is a fast return that **clearly separates the spike from the post-spike segment**.
- The **post-spike segment reflects a refractory trajectory** that gently transitions toward the original baseline — not above, not significantly below.
- The overall shape is clean and smooth, without jagged edges, multi-peaks, or high-frequency fluctuations.

❌ Poor-Quality Waveform Indicators:
- **Pre-spike segment is noisy** or ramps up/down instead of being flat.
- The **spike is too wide**, has rounded edges, or lacks a well-defined negative peak.
- A large or prolonged refractory undershoot (staying significantly below baseline) is a poor-quality indicator. Minor, brief dips below baseline can occur in real neurons and should not, on their own, be considered a fail.
- The **baseline before and after the spike are misaligned**, indicating instability or distortion.
- The waveform contains **extra bumps**, slow transitions, or ambiguous curvature.
- Noise is embedded into the shape, making the structure indistinct.

⚠️ Notes:
- Do not rely on the presence of a peak and rebound — these can appear even in artifacts or noise clusters.
- Ignore the absolute amplitude. Focus only on **the consistency, baseline alignment, and clean triphasic structure**.
- A unit should be judged as bad only if it fails multiple major criteria. Minor violations, especially if the rest of the waveform is clean, should not outweigh other positive sign in other categories.
- REPEAT: A unit should be judged as bad only if it fails multiple major criteria. Minor violations, especially if the rest of the waveform is clean, should not outweigh other positive sign in other categories.

STEP 1.Begin by describing the unit waveform plot in a very detail manner based solely on visual inspection. Do not reference the guideline at this stage—simply describe what you observe.
STEP 2.Interpret your observations in the context of the guideline provided above. Make a holistic assessment, considering multiple criteria together. A unit should only be judged as good if it meets several criteria, and as bad if it fails multiple criteria—not based on a single factor alone.
STEP 3.Finally You should return a clear decision on whether the feature image likely represents a good or bad or borderline cases.
