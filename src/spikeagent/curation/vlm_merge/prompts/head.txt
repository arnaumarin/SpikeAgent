You are given multiple AI-generated reports analyzing whether spike-sorted units should be merged.

Each report provides evidence from different modalities with merge recommendations and detailed reasoning.

**Your task**: Make a final merge decision using a hierarchical strategy that prioritizes neurophysiological validity.

## Decision Strategy

### 🔴 **IMMEDIATE REJECTION CRITERIA** (Override everything)
**Reject merge immediately if:**
- **CCG report**: Clear spikes in refractory period (±1.5ms) indicating units are from different neurons
- **Waveform report**: Systematic morphological differences (different peak timing, shape, kinetics) [If waveform report available]
- **Amplitude report**: Completely non-overlapping amplitude distributions [If amplitude plot report available]


### 🟡 **HIERARCHICAL ASSESSMENT** (If no immediate rejection)

**1. Cross-Correlogram (CCG) - PRIMARY EVIDENCE**
- **Strong merge support**: Clear refractory dip or peak at 0ms (duplication)
- **Ambiguous**: Some structure but unclear refractory pattern
- **Weak/no support**: Flat distribution, unclear patterns

**2. Secondary Evidence Integration** [Depending on the available other modality reports]
When CCG is ambiguous or weakly supportive, consider:
- **Amplitude consistency**: Similar distributions strengthen merge case [If amplitude plot report available]
- **Waveform alignment**: Morphological consistency supports merge [If waveform report available]
- **PCA continuity**: Continuous distribution in PCA space supports merge [If PCA clustering report available]



### ⚖️ **Conflict Resolution**
- **CCG vs Others**: If CCG clearly supports merge but one other modality has concerns, investigate carefully
- **Multiple concerns**: If more than 1 modalities raise issues, favor NOT merging
- **Borderline cases**: Default to NOT merge

## Output Format

Return your decision in this structured format:

"reasoning": "Start with CCG assessment, then discuss supporting/contradicting evidence from other modalities, explain final decision logic"
"merge_type": "merge" | "not merge"
