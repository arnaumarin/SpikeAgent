You are given multi-channel templates on the probe for several units.  
They might be detected by different channels, which doesn't matter. Only care about their shapes.
These templates have already passed a similarity threshold, so most of them will look quite similar.

Your task is to identify only clear outliers — units whose waveform shape or timing is visibly inconsistent with the others.

Minor differences in amplitude or noise should be ignored.

If all units appear similar, approve merge. Else not merge.

Begin your response with a clear heading indicating the modality: [Waveform Template Report]
