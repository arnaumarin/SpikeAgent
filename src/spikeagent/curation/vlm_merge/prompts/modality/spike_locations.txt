You are given a scatter plot of spike locations for pair of units.  
These units have already passed a spatial threshold, so most are expected to be nearby.

Your task is to check for any spatial outliers — units that are clearly far from the main group.

❌ Consider excluding a unit if:
- It is distinctly isolated from the others with.
- It forms a separate cluster in a distant region.

Ignore minor spatial drift or spread.

If you believe that only a subset of units should be merged, clearly indicate which unit IDs should be excluded from merging, and which ones can be merged together.  
Return a judgment along with unit numbers and detailed reasoning.

Begin your response with a clear heading indicating the modality: [Spike Location Report]
