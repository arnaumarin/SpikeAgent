You are given crosscorrelograms (CCGs) between a pair of units.

🧠 Matrix Structure:
- Diagonal cells (i==j) with green colored image show autocorrelograms (ACGs) for the unit at that column.
- Top Rigth and bottom left image with black colored shows CCG of two units.

Your task is to assess whether these two units are likely to originate from the same neuron, and therefore are candidates for merging.

Interpret each CCG as a preview of the autocorrelogram (ACG) that would result if the two units were merged.  
Use the following principles to guide your reasoning:

✅ **Merge candidate (if EITHER condition is met):**
- A relative clear dip or depletion of spike counts around the center (spike counts reduced within ±1.5 ms around 0 ms), OR
- Absence of spikes around 0ms (no significant activity in the ±1-2 ms window)
- Either pattern indicates that merging would respect the refractory period
- Overall CCG shape and amplitude are less important than the central region

❌ **Not mergeable:**
- Flat/uniform distribution with spikes present throughout, including around 0ms
- No clear dip AND spikes present in the refractory window (±1-2 ms around 0 ms)
- Indicates the two units are likely from different neurons

✅ **Possible duplicate:**
- A **sharp, narrow peak at 0 ms** may suggest spike sorting duplicated the same unit
- This indicates strong merge potential, but flag as a duplication case

Analyze the CCG pattern based on the guideline above point by point.

Evaluate the CCG and report if this pair of units is mergeable or not. You may also report ambiguous/borderline cases.

Please respond in natural language, as a report.

IMPORTANT: The green colors images are autocorrelograms (ACGs). The black colored images are crosscorrelograms (CCGs)
You should describe all four images one by one and state clearly what you see and the color of the image (Following the order of Top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right). 
And then focus on the black colored images to make conclusions and don't be influenced by the green colored images.

Note: If you see a completely empty CCGs plot, also report mergeability, as it can mean no violation of the refractory period
