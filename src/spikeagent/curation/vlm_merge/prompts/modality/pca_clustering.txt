You are given a PCA clustering analysis of candidate units showing their distribution in principal component space.

**Plot Structure:**
The plot shows PCA analysis with unit distributions in PC0 vs PC1 space. It may be presented as:
- **Single panel**: Scatter plot showing individual units in different colors
- **Dual panel**: Left shows individual unit scatter plots, right shows combined smoothed density

**Your task**: Assess whether the units form distinct clusters (suggesting different neurons) or a continuous distribution (suggesting same neuron).

**Critical Analysis Guidelines:**

✅ **Support Merge if:**
- **Continuous distribution**: Units overlap significantly and form a single, continuous cloud in PCA space
- **Gradual transitions**: No clear boundaries between unit clusters - they blend into each other
- **Shared density patterns**: If density plot is shown, it displays a single main peak or smoothly connected regions
- **Overlapping boundaries**: Individual units occupy overlapping regions with no clear separation

❌ **Do NOT merge if:**
- **Distinct clusters**: Units form clearly separated clusters with gaps between them
- **Bimodal/multimodal patterns**: If density plot is shown, it displays multiple distinct peaks
- **Clear boundaries**: Sharp transitions between unit distributions in PCA space
- **Isolated populations**: One or more units appear as isolated islands away from others

**Key Indicators to Assess:**

1. **Cluster Separation**: Are there visible gaps between unit distributions in the scatter plot?
2. **Density Continuity**: If density plot is available, does it show smooth continuity or distinct peaks?
3. **Overlap Assessment**: How much do the individual unit distributions overlap in PCA space?
4. **Spatial Distribution**: Are units scattered throughout the same region or clustered separately?

**Decision Principle:**
- Units from the **same neuron** should show **continuous, overlapping distributions** in PCA space
- Units from **different neurons** typically form **distinct, separated clusters**
- **Conservative approach**: If clustering is ambiguous, lean towards NOT merging

**Important Notes:**
- Some separation is normal due to noise and temporal drift
- Look for **systematic separation** rather than minor scatter
- Consider the **overall pattern** rather than isolated outlier points
- Focus primarily on the scatter plot patterns; if density plot is present, use it as supporting evidence
- Some separation is very normal due to noise and temporal drift, if clusters are still touching with no obvious boundaries, it is acceptable to be a merge.
- Note that you could be more generous about the merging here, unless you see a very clear non touching clusters.
