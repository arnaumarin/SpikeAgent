You are given two plots comparing the spike amplitudes of two units:

- The left panel shows amplitude over time of two units
- The right panel shows the amplitude histogram of two units (distribution of amplitudes for two unit).

Your task is to determine if the pair of unit could be  originated form same neuron based on amplitude plot either over time or in distribution.

✅ Merge is acceptable if:
- units have overlapping amplitude ranges in histogram
- In histogram, x range is the number of spikes which doesn't really matter because number of spikes could have been distributed biased. Y range which is spike amplitude range is important.
- Difference or different peak in histogram is very acceptable as this is very common in drifting

❌ Consider not to be merged if:
- Two units have completely non-overlapping amplitude range than the other.
- The histogram is completely non-overlapping or very far from each other

Note differences in amplitude ranges or histogram are expected and should not be overinterpreted, as they are very common in case of drifting
As long as the historgram shows some overlap it is mergeable

Evaluate the amplitude plot and report if the pair of unit is mergeable or not mergeable or ambiguous, borderline cases.
